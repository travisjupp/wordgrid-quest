# Contributing

Check the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/travisjupp/projects/2/views/2) Todos and Roadmap to see what needs to be done and follow the instructions below.


## Contribute Code

1. Fork the Repository:
Navigate to the project's page on GitHub.
Click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub
account. 

2. Clone your Fork:
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. 

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wordgrid-quest.git
```
Navigate into the newly created directory. 
```bash
    cd wordgrid-quest
```

3. Create a Branch:
Create a new branch for your changes: 
```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
(Replace your-branch-name with a descriptive name for your changes). 

4. Make Changes:
Make your desired modifications to the code or documentation.
Stage and commit your changes with descriptive messages: 
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

5. Pushing to your Fork:
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub: 
```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. Creating a Pull Request:
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click on the "New pull request" button.
Select the base branch (usually main or master in the original repository) and
your branch.
Review your changes and create the pull request. 

7. Review and Discussion:
The project maintainers will review your pull request.
They may request changes or provide feedback.
You may need to make further commits to address their comments, pushing them to your branch. 

8. Merging or Closing:
Once your pull request is approved, the maintainers will merge it into the main repository.
If your changes are not suitable, the pull request may be closed.
