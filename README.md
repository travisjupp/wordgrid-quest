# WordGrid Quest

The WordGrid Quest learning tool gamifies practicing study-terms using a word-grid similar to a word-scramble. A user uploads terms (with definitions) that are added to the grid (scrambled) for the user to discover with assistance from various hinting systems under a time constraint.

This project uses React Native (Expo) for a multi-platform reach while maintaining code in a single codebase; React Redux for state management; Google's Material Design 3 design system for design consistency across devices and accessibility standards; React Native Paper theming system linked to a Figma prototype's exported Material Theme JSON; and is project managed, organized, and versioned on the Github Projects platform for ease of collaboration, source-control, and time management.

...More to come!
